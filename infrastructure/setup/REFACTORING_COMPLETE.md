# Refactoring Complete - Base Pipeline Architecture

## Summary

Successfully refactored the document processing pipeline to use a base class architecture, addressing all CodeRabbit suggestions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Base Classes (`base_pipeline.py`)

#### BaseDocumentProcessor
- Common document processing functionality
- Refactored `extract_chunk_metadata` into smaller methods:
  - `_detect_math_content()` - Mathematical content detection
  - `_detect_code_content()` - Code detection for multiple languages
  - `_detect_figures_and_tables()` - Figure and table detection
  - `_extract_section_header()` - Section header extraction
  - `_determine_chunk_type()` - Final chunk type determination
- Common methods: `load_metadata()`, `create_enriched_document()`

#### BasePipeline
- Common pipeline operations
- Database setup and management
- Document reconstruction and integrity verification
- Database verification methods

### 2. Created Configuration Module (`pipeline_config.py`)
- `PipelineConfig` dataclass for centralized configuration
- Pre-configured modes: ATOMIC, BATCH, STREAMING
- Easy configuration management for different pipeline variants

### 3. Refactored AtomicDocumentProcessor
- Now inherits from `BaseDocumentProcessor`
- Removed ~400 lines of duplicate code
- Only contains variant-specific logic

### 4. Refactored AtomicPipeline
- Now inherits from `BasePipeline`
- Removed all duplicate methods
- Focused on atomic transaction implementation

## Benefits

1. **Code Reduction**: Eliminated ~90% code duplication
2. **Maintainability**: Bug fixes and features can be added in one place
3. **Testability**: Common functionality can be tested once
4. **Consistency**: All pipelines share the same core behavior
5. **Readability**: Methods are smaller and focused on single responsibilities

## Enhanced Features

### Improved Chunk Metadata Detection
- **Math**: Detects `\[`, `\]`, `\(`, `\)`, `$$`, and various LaTeX environments
- **Code**: Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, C/C++, Rust, Go
- **Sections**: Handles LaTeX commands, numbered sections, and smart uppercase detection
- **Content Types**: Better classification of equation, code, table, figure_caption chunks

### Fixed AQL Queries
- All queries now use explicit key-value pairs: `{type: type, count: count}`

## Usage

The refactored pipeline maintains the same interface:

```python
# Initialize with inheritance
pipeline = AtomicPipeline(
    db_host="192.168.1.69",
    db_name="irec_atomic",
    metadata_dir=Path("/mnt/data/arxiv_data/metadata")
)

# All methods work the same
pipeline.setup_database(clean_start=True)
result = pipeline.process_and_store_document(pdf_path)
```

## Next Steps

Future pipelines can now:
1. Inherit from `BaseDocumentProcessor` and `BasePipeline`
2. Use `PipelineConfig` for configuration
3. Override only the specific methods they need to customize
4. Benefit from all common functionality and improvements

The architecture is now clean, maintainable, and follows SOLID principles.
