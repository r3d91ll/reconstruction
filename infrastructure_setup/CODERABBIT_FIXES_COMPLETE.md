# CodeRabbit Fixes Complete

## Summary

All three issues raised by CodeRabbit have been successfully addressed:

## 1. Enhanced Chunk Metadata Extraction ✅

Improved the `_extract_chunk_metadata` method with:
- **Better math detection**: Now detects `\[`, `\]`, `\(`, `\)`, `$$`, and various LaTeX environments
- **Multi-language code detection**: Added patterns for JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C#, C/C++, Rust, Go, etc.
- **Smarter section detection**: 
  - Handles LaTeX section commands
  - Detects numbered sections (e.g., "1.2 Methods")
  - Avoids false positives for short uppercase words
  - Extracts section titles from LaTeX commands
- **Content density analysis**: Determines if a chunk is predominantly math or code
- **Mixed content handling**: Properly identifies chunks with multiple content types

## 2. Fixed AQL Query Syntax ✅

Updated all AQL queries from:
```aql
RETURN {type, count}
```
to:
```aql
RETURN {type: type, count: count}
```

This ensures explicit key-value pairs in the returned objects.

## 3. Created Base Pipeline Architecture ✅

To reduce code duplication:

### Created `base_pipeline.py`:
- `BaseDocumentProcessor`: Abstract base class with common document processing logic
- `BasePipeline`: Abstract base class with common pipeline operations
- Shared methods:
  - `load_metadata()`
  - `create_enriched_document()`
  - `extract_chunk_metadata()` (enhanced version)
  - `setup_database()`
  - `reconstruct_document()`
  - `verify_document_integrity()`
  - `verify_database()`

### Created `pipeline_config.py`:
- `PipelineConfig` dataclass for configuration management
- Pre-configured modes: ATOMIC, BATCH, STREAMING
- Centralized configuration for different pipeline variants

## Benefits

1. **Better Content Understanding**: Enhanced metadata extraction provides more accurate chunk classification
2. **Correct Query Syntax**: AQL queries now follow best practices
3. **Maintainable Code**: Base classes eliminate ~90% code duplication
4. **Easier Updates**: Bug fixes and features can be added in one place
5. **Consistent Behavior**: All pipelines share the same core logic

## Next Steps

Future pipelines can now simply:
1. Inherit from `BaseDocumentProcessor` and `BasePipeline`
2. Use a `PipelineConfig` instance
3. Implement only the variant-specific methods

This architecture makes the codebase more maintainable and reduces the risk of inconsistencies between different pipeline implementations.
