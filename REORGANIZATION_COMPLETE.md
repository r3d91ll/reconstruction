# Repository Reorganization Complete

## What Was Done

Successfully separated the mixed repository into clear paper and infrastructure components.

## New Structure

```

## Key Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Theory work vs implementation details
2. **Easy Future Split**: When ready, just move `infrastructure/` to new repo
3. **Focused Documentation**: Each area has its own CLAUDE.md
4. **Clean Dependencies**: Paper doesn't depend on infrastructure
5. **Shared Experiments**: Bridge between theory and implementation

## Files Moved

### To `paper/`:
- THESIS_REVIEW_TRACKING.md
- THESIS_REVISION_PLAN.md
- FrameworkAcademicValidationStrategy.md
- ASYNCHRONOUS_DECAY_FORMALIZATION.md
- FRAME_DISCOVERY_METHOD.md
- validation/ directory

### To `infrastructure/`:
- irec_infrastructure/ package
- All files from infrastructure_setup/
- Test files and logs
- setup.py and setup_venv.sh

### To `experiments/`:
- Copies of experiment_1 and experiment_2 (kept in validation/ for now)

## Next Steps

1. Update any hardcoded paths in scripts
2. Test that experiments still run correctly
3. Update CI/CD if applicable
4. Consider creating separate requirements.txt for each component

## For Future Repository Split

When ready to separate:
1. Create new repository for infrastructure
2. Move entire `infrastructure/` directory
3. Update experiments to import from separate package
4. Keep `paper/` in original repository

The clean separation makes this straightforward!
