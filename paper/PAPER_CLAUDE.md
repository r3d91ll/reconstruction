This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the theoretical framework and academic paper for Information Reconstructionism.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework and mathematical validation for Information Reconstructionism - a new theory of observer-dependent information existence.

## Project Goal

**Prove that information exists as a multiplicative function of dimensional prerequisites, manifesting only through observer interaction.**

## Core Equation

```
Information(i→j|S-O) = WHERE × WHAT × CONVEYANCE × TIME × FRAME
```

If ANY dimension = 0, then Information = 0

## Key Claims to Prove

### 1. Multiplicative Model

- Information requires ALL dimensions > 0
- Not additive: you can't compensate for missing dimensions
- Empirically testable through zero propagation

### 2. Context Amplification

- Context acts as exponential amplifier: Context^α
- Different domains have different α values (1.5-2.0)
- Measurable through conveyance analysis

### 3. Observer Dependency

- Different observers create different information realities
- FRAME function determines what information exists
- A-Observer vs S-Observer perspectives

### 4. Theory-Practice Bridges

- High-conveyance connections between abstract and concrete
- Discoverable through dimensional analysis
- Key to knowledge transformation

## Validation Strategy

### Mathematical Validation

1. Prove multiplicative model mathematically
2. Validate dimensional bounds (Johnson-Lindenstrauss)
3. Show convergence properties
4. Demonstrate stability of Context^α

### Empirical Validation

1. Test zero propagation (any dimension = 0)
2. Measure context amplification values
3. Find real theory-practice bridges
4. Compare observer perspectives

### Computational Validation

1. Implement minimal proof-of-concept
2. Process test corpus (100-1000 documents)
3. Visualize dimensional relationships
4. Demonstrate bridge discovery

## Success Criteria

### For Academic Presentation

- [ ] Mathematical proofs complete and verified
- [ ] Empirical evidence from test corpus
- [ ] Working demonstration (minimal viable)
- [ ] Clear differentiation from existing theories

### For Publication

- [ ] Formal mathematical framework
- [ ] Reproducible experiments
- [ ] Statistical validation
- [ ] Peer review responses ready

## Current Status

### Theory: [In Progress]

- Core framework documented
- Mathematical foundations laid
- Critical responses addressed

### Validation: [Pending]

- Wolfram validation script ready
- Python implementation needed
- Test corpus selection required

### Evidence: [Partial]

- Zero propagation conceptually proven
- Context amplification theoretical
- Bridge discovery methodology defined

## Key Differentiators

### From Traditional Information Theory

- Observer-dependent (not universal)
- Multiplicative (not additive)
- Dimensional (not scalar)

### From Semantic Similarity

- Includes actionability (CONVEYANCE)
- Context amplifies exponentially
- Bridges have special properties

### From Standard RAG/Embeddings

- Theory-grounded dimensions
- Observer-relative retrieval
- Bridge-based navigation

## Remember

This section focuses ONLY on proving the theoretical framework. Implementation details, infrastructure, and applications are handled separately. The goal is academic validation and publication of the core theory.

**Focus areas**:

1. Mathematical rigor
2. Empirical validation
3. Clear presentation
4. Reproducible results

**Avoid**:

1. Implementation complexity
2. Infrastructure details
3. Mythological allegories
4. Scope creep

The theory stands on its own mathematical and empirical merits.
