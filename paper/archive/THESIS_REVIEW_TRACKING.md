# Thesis Review Deficiency Tracking

## 1. Theory Logical Consistency Issues

### 1.1 Dimensional Incompatibility ❌

- **Issue**: Multiplicative model produces dimensionless values [0,1] while Shannon entropy has units (bits)
- **Severity**: Critical - Category error preventing mathematical integration
- **Options**:
  - [ ] Develop rigorous mapping function between spaces
  - [ ] Reformulate for dimensional consistency
  - [ ] Scope theory as "information accessibility" not "information content"
- **Status**: Addressed

---
 **How we address this critique**: Shannon's Entropy happens within dimensions NOT between them. Our hypothesis is that the differential decay is one of the drivers that both increases and decreases conveyance between objects

## Your Insight Unpacked

**Within-dimension entropy**: Each dimension has its own Shannon entropy


- H(WHERE) = entropy of spatial/access distribution (bits)
- H(WHAT) = entropy of semantic content distribution (bits)  
- H(CONVEYANCE) = entropy of transformation potential (bits)
- H(TIME) = entropy of temporal distribution (bits)

**Normalization**: Convert each to [0,1] by dividing by max entropy for that dimension

- WHERE_norm = H(WHERE) / H_max(WHERE)
- WHAT_norm = H(WHAT) / H_max(WHAT)
- etc.

**Multiplicative interaction**: I = WHERE_norm × WHAT_norm × CONVEYANCE_norm × TIME_norm

## Why This Resolves the Tension

1. **Shannon applies within dimensions**: ✓ Each dimension's internal structure measured in bits
2. **Multiplication is dimensionless**: ✓ Normalized ratios can be multiplied
3. **Physical precedent**: Many physical laws multiply different dimensional quantities (P = V × I, F = m × a)

## The Asynchronous Decay Insight

This is particularly elegant - each dimension has its own "decay rate":

- WHERE might decay slowly (infrastructure persists)
- WHAT might shift semantically over time
- CONVEYANCE could decay quickly (methods become outdated)
- TIME inherently progresses

The **interactions** between these different decay rates create the complex dynamics you're studying.

## Mathematical Formalization

```
I(t) = ∏[H_i(t) / H_max,i] 
     = ∏ normalized_entropy_i(t)

where each dimension i has its own entropy evolution H_i(t)
```

### 1.2 Circular Reasoning in Context Amplification ❌

- **Issue**: Applied α = 1.5 then "discovered" it was 1.5 (reverse-engineering)
- **Severity**: Critical - Undermines empirical validation
- **Solution**: Need ground truth measures of context strength independent of model
- **Status**: waiting on experiment_2 to finish

---
**How we address this critique**: Yeah I did not like that return and investigate. it turns our that experiment_1 when we ran it we do so on mock-data that we created during our development process.  That particular experiment should be seen more as us getting our pipeline in order.  Experiment_2 should have resolved this issue so we are waiting on that return before proceeding with this further

### 1.3 Observer Dependency Underspecified ❌

- **Issue**: Implementation uses single "omniscient" viewpoint; FRAME dimension vanished
- **Severity**: High - Central claim not implemented
- **Solution**: Fully develop FRAME dimension or remove observer dependency claims
- **Status**: addressed
 
---
**How we address this critique**: ok so you have to understand what we have to discover frame from the point of view of an object within a graph. If that object is say a research paper then the citation from that paper to others future in the timeline and then those papers ability to spawn more data as evidenced by citations is one metric for how we can measure the conveyance of an object. we then map the semantic chunks between those citation links in the documents and we should begin to see patterns we can then infer how to mathmaticaly define FRAME...si this what you mean? I need to bring my method into the theory?
Edit

### Bottom-Up FRAME Discovery Method

```text
Paper A → cites → Paper B → spawns → Papers C, D, E
    ↓                ↓                    ↓
[semantic chunks] [semantic chunks] [semantic chunks]
    
```

By analyzing which chunks propagate and transform, 
we can infer the "FRAME" that enabled the transfer


    - FRAME emerges from data: Rather than imposing observer categories, you discover what actually matters for information transfer
    - Citation networks reveal observer behavior: Papers that cite each other share some implicit FRAME
    - Semantic chunk evolution shows transformation: How concepts mutate reveals the processing capacity required

    - FRAME isn't a user property (like "PhD student" or "expert")
    = FRAME is a relationship property - the compatibility between an information source and potential receiver
    - We can measure it by observing successful vs failed information transfers

Add a section like:

    "Rather than defining FRAME as a static observer property, we discover it empirically through citation network analysis. FRAME emerges as the latent compatibility factor that enables information transfer between nodes in our network. By analyzing:

        Citation patterns (which papers successfully build on others)
        Semantic chunk propagation (which concepts transfer vs transform vs die)
        Temporal evolution (how quickly information propagates through different subnetworks)

    We can infer the mathematical structure of FRAME as a compatibility function between source and receiver."

This transforms observer dependency from a philosophical claim to an empirically discoverable phenomenon.

"FRAME is a relationship property - the compatibility between an information source and potential receiver" it is a relationship property but it is directional. the FRAME relationship doesnt ahve to be equal between point a and b.

This asymmetry is important for the theory and should be highlighted.

Exactly! This is a crucial refinement. FRAME is directional/asymmetric. This actually makes your theory much more powerful and realistic.
Directional FRAME Examples

```test
Paper A ──FRAME(A→B)──> Paper B
Paper A <──FRAME(B→A)── Paper B

Where FRAME(A→B) ≠ FRAME(B→A)
```

Real examples:

    - Shannon's 1948 paper → Modern ML paper: High FRAME (modern paper can easily understand/build on Shannon)
    - Modern ML paper → Shannon's 1948 paper: Low/Zero FRAME (Shannon couldn't comprehend transformers)
    - Technical paper → Review paper: Moderate FRAME (review can synthesize)
    - Review paper → Technical paper: High FRAME (technical details accessible from overview)

This Explains Natural Information Flow

The directionality creates natural "gradients" in your information landscape:

Information flows "downhill" along FRAME gradients

- From accessible → specialized (teaching)
- From specialized → accessible (popularization)  
- From past → future (building on work)
- But NOT equally in reverse

Mathematical Implication

Your transfer function becomes:

Information_transfer(i→j) = WHERE(i) × WHAT(i,j) × CONVEYANCE(i) × TIME(i,j) × FRAME(i→j)

Where FRAME(i→j) is the directed compatibility from source i to receiver j.

This asymmetry is what creates:

    Knowledge hierarchies
    Prerequisite structures
    The irreversibility of certain information flows
    Why some papers become "bridges" (high bidirectional FRAME)

## Major Dataset Update (2025-01-24)

### New Approach: Complete arXiv Download
- **Scope**: Downloading entire arXiv from 1991 to present
- **Path**: `/mnt/data/arxiv_data/` (pdf/ and metadata/ subdirectories)
- **Format**: 
  - PDFs: `YYMM.NNNNN.pdf` (e.g., 2507.17087.pdf)
  - Metadata: `YYMM.NNNNN.json` with title, authors, abstract, categories, dates
  - Pre-2007: Older format like `hep-lat_9204001.pdf`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Addresses Issue 3.6 (Limited Domain Testing) - full disciplinary coverage
  - Enables true cross-domain validation
  - arXiv as "cultural object" allows studying discipline-specific primitives
  - Natural chronological ordering for temporal analysis

### How This Addresses Review Concerns:
1. **Cross-Domain Testing**: Full arXiv means all disciplines represented
2. **Temporal Controls**: Can track same authors/topics over time
3. **Natural Experiment**: arXiv's evolution provides organic context changes
4. **Scale Validation**: Millions of papers vs thousands
