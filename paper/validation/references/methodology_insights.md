# Methodology Insights from "Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence"

## Key Parallels to Information Reconstructionism

### 1. Bottom-up vs Top-down Approach

**Their Framework:**
- LMs trained on general corpora acquire "top-down" surface-level regularities
- Deep expertise requires "bottom-up" understanding from fundamental axioms
- Knowledge Graphs provide structured primitives that compose into complex reasoning

**Our Framework:**
- Traditional information retrieval focuses on "top-down" semantic similarity
- Effective theory-to-practice transfer requires "bottom-up" dimensional composition
- Context acts as exponential amplifier when all dimensions are present

### 2. Multiplicative Composition

**Their Approach:**
- KG paths capture composite relations through multi-hop traversal
- Example: (Methane → Contains Bond → C-H Bond) × (C-H Bond → Is Type Of → Sigma Bond)
- Complexity emerges from composing simple primitives

**Our Approach:**
- Information = WHERE × WHAT × CONVEYANCE × TIME × FRAME
- Zero propagation: any dimension = 0 → total information = 0
- Context^α provides exponential amplification

### 3. Experimental Methodology

**Their Testing Protocol:**
- 24,000 grounded reasoning tasks from KG paths
- Stratified evaluation across 15 ICD medical domains
- Path length controls reasoning complexity (1-hop to 5-hop)
- Two-factor correctness verification with independent graders

**Adaptation for Our Work:**
- Generate paper-implementation pairs with varying context levels
- Stratify across CS domains (ML, Systems, Theory, HCI)
- Control complexity via dimensional completeness
- Cross-validate with multiple annotators

### 4. Curriculum Design

**Their Curriculum:**
```python
# Progressive depth training
QwQ-Med-1: 8,000 single-hop tasks
QwQ-Med-2: 16,000 one+two-hop tasks  
QwQ-Med-3: 24,000 one+two+three-hop tasks
```

**Our Curriculum:**
```python
# Progressive context enrichment
Level-1: Math only (minimal context)
Level-2: Math + pseudocode (moderate context)
Level-3: Math + pseudocode + examples (rich context)
Level-4: Math + pseudocode + examples + code (complete context)
```

### 5. Diversity Sampling

**Their Method:**
```python
# Sample nodes inversely proportional to frequency
P(node_i) = (1 + ε) / (f_i + ε)
```

**Our Adaptation:**
```python
# Sample papers ensuring domain coverage
P(paper_i) = weight_domain × weight_year × weight_citations
```

## Methodological Improvements for Our Work

### 1. Structured Path Generation

Instead of just measuring context elements, trace "implementation paths":
- Theory → Pseudocode → Example → Code → Implementation
- Each step must satisfy dimensional requirements
- Measure path completion rates

### 2. Quality Filtering Pipeline

**Multi-stage filtering (adapted from their approach):**
1. **Structural Filtering**: Valid paper-implementation pairs
2. **Quality Filtering**: Remove low-quality implementations (<10 stars)
3. **Correctness Filtering**: Verify implementation matches paper
4. **Diversity Filtering**: Ensure broad domain coverage

### 3. Thinking Trace Analogy

**Their approach**: Generate reasoning traces grounded in KG paths

**Our approach**: Generate "implementation traces":
- How did developer interpret the theory?
- Which context elements were crucial?
- What bridges connected abstract to concrete?

### 4. Evaluation Suite Design

**ICD-Bench equivalent for CS:**
```
CS-Implementation-Bench:
├── Machine Learning (transformers, CNNs, RNNs)
├── Computer Vision (detection, segmentation)
├── NLP (parsing, generation, translation)
├── Systems (databases, networking, OS)
├── Theory (algorithms, complexity, crypto)
└── HCI (interfaces, accessibility, design)
```

### 5. Hypothesis Testing Framework

**Adopt their hypothesis structure:**

**H1: Context Amplification**
- Null: Context adds linearly to transfer success
- Alternative: Context^α amplifies multiplicatively (α > 1)

**H2: Zero Propagation**  
- Null: Missing dimensions reduce effectiveness
- Alternative: Any dimension = 0 → transfer = 0

**H3: Domain Variation**
- Null: α constant across domains
- Alternative: Different domains have different α values

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Generation Pipeline
```python
def generate_implementation_curriculum():
    # 1. Sample diverse papers
    papers = stratified_sample(arxiv_papers, 
                            domains=['cs.LG', 'cs.CV', 'cs.CL'],
                            years=range(2015, 2024))
    
    # 2. Find verified implementations
    implementations = find_github_implementations(papers)
    
    # 3. Generate context levels
    for paper, impl in zip(papers, implementations):
        contexts = generate_context_levels(paper)
        traces = extract_implementation_traces(impl)
        
    # 4. Quality filtering
    filtered = multi_stage_filter(contexts, traces)
    
    return filtered
```

### Phase 2: Experimental Validation

1. **Controlled A/B Testing**:
   - Group A: Semantic similarity retrieval
   - Group B: Context-amplified retrieval
   - Measure: Implementation success rate

2. **Longitudinal Study**:
   - Track papers over time
   - Measure implementation lag vs context completeness
   - Validate Context^α relationship

3. **Cross-domain Validation**:
   - Test α values across CS subfields
   - Identify domain-specific patterns
   - Build predictive models

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structured primitives compose multiplicatively** - both in KG reasoning and information transfer
2. **Bottom-up curriculum design** enables deeper understanding than top-down approaches
3. **Path-based evaluation** provides more insight than point metrics
4. **Multi-stage quality control** is essential for reliable results
5. **Domain stratification** reveals important variations in transfer dynamics
